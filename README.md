# Advent of Code 2025

This repo contains the code to solve the puzzles from [2025 Advent of
Code](https://adventofcode.com/2025). The README.md file in the folder for
each day contains my observations when solving that day's puzzle.

## Instructions

Unless day-specific README.md files contain specific instructions, use the
following commands to execute the solution.

- `crystal dayX.cr <filename>`
- `elixir dayX.exs <filename>`
- `cargo run <filename>`
- `scala dayX.scala -- <filename>`
