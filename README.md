# Advent of Code 2025

This repo contains the code to solve the puzzles from [2025 Advent of
Code](https://adventofcode.com/2025). The README.md file in the folder for
each day contains my observations when solving that day's puzzle.

|Language | Days
|---------|-------
|[Crystal (v1.18.2)](https://crystal-lang.org) | 1, 5, 9
|[Elixir (v1.19.4)](https://elixir-lang.org)   | 2, 6, 10
|[Rust (v1.91.1)](https://rust-lang.org)       | 3, 7, 11
|[Scala (v3.7.4)](https://scala-lang.org)      | 4, 8, 12

Unless day specific README.md file contains specific instructions, use the
following commands to execute the solution.

- `crystal dayX.cr <filename>`
- `elixir dayX.exs <filename>`
- `cargo run <filename>`
- `scala dayX.scala -- <filename>`
